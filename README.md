## 🧬 About the Experience

The **Cyber-Academic Portfolio** redefines the idea of a faculty webpage.  
Instead of a static résumé site, this project delivers a **cinematic, interactive experience** symbolizing the intersection of:

- Academia  
- Artificial Intelligence  
- Cybersecurity  
- Innovation  
- Human curiosity  

A living visual metaphor for a brain in motion — where research, teaching, and creativity form a neural web of infinite possibility.

## ✨ Core Features

🧠 **3D Neural Network Background**  
A dynamic particle-based visual built with **Three.js**, simulating  
the interconnected nature of learning, thought, and research.  
Responsive to movement — *the system reacts as the mind engages.*

❄️ **Glassmorphism Interface**  
Frosted panels float above the 3D world to deliver information without breaking immersion.

📱 **Responsive UI Architecture**  
Pixel-perfect across Desktop, Tablet & Mobile — accessibility baked in.

🎭 **Hover & Motion Animations**  
Micro-interactions & smooth transitions powered by Tailwind CSS.

🛰️ **Single-Page Intelligent Navigation**  
Sections stitched together with smart scrolling:
- Home
- About
- Expertise (AI/ML, Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, Academia)
- Timeline & Achievements
- Contact & Social Handles
